```

This report has been **automatically generated** using the data collected on Moodle on *`r as.Date(as.character(FileDate),format = "%Y%m%d")`* . The first step is the data cleaning of the raw log file, or *event data set* (file *`r paste0("logs_DTV20_", FileDate,".csv")`*)

# Data 


```{r LogData}

data_log <- read.csv(paste0("Data/logs_DTV20_", FileDate,".csv"))

FileNameLog <- paste0("Data/logs_DTV20_", FileDate,".csv") 

# I have a strange pb with the name of the Time variable. fixing it quick and dirty mode !
data_log <- data_log %>% 
  rename(Time = Ã¯..Time ) 

nrow(data_log)

```

The Moodle platform allows the recording of many events during a course. Several data sets can then be downloaded (in *.csv* format) for an analysis of the activity of the learners. Each row of this log is an event and so all the events (course viewed, post, attempt to a test, , etc. ) are recorded, with a time stamp, in a single log file.  One field gathers the detail of each event as a text message. This field can be parsed and information on the user, the activity and the event can be extracted. For this course, we recorded **`r nrow(data_log)`** events of different nature, that have to be cleaned.   

```{r cleaning}
## Remove less relevant observations 
#remove administrators

data_log <- data_log[!(data_log$User.full.name=="Christophe Bontemps" |
                         data_log$User.full.name=="Ni Ni Thein" |
                         data_log$Component=="Recycle bin"),]
```



```{r RemoveEvents}
#remove less relevant events

r <- unique(data_log$Event.name)
# the events to remove

rem_events <- c("Tour ended", "Tour ended", "Group member added","Role assigned",
                "Course searched", "User list viewed", "User profile viewed",
                "Subscription created", 
                "User profile viewed", "User list viewed", "Course user report viewed",
                "Badge listing viewed", "User report viewed", "Course module instance list viewed",
                "Read tracking disabled", 
                "User enrolled in course", "Discussion deleted" , "Post deleted", 
                "Step shown", "Tour started", "Tour reset", "Quiz report viewed",
                "Subscription deleted", "User unenrolled from course", "Group member removed",
                "Role unassigned",  "Discussion subscription deleted", "Tag added to an item",
                "Grade deleted", tail(r, n=11))

# remove events
data_log <- data_log[!data_log$Event.name %in% rem_events, ]

```

### Cleaning and first elements

> One important step is to extract sand identify activities  from  the *Description* field and to affect identification numbers (IDs) to activities, Modules, types of activities, etc.  


```{r ExtractIDs}
# Extract course ID
CourseID <- str_match(data_log$Description, "(?i)\\bcourse with id '?\\s*(\\d+)")[,2]


# Extract Learners ID
LearnerID <- str_match(data_log$Description, "(?i)\\buser with id '?\\s*(\\d+)")[,2]

# Extract module ID
ModuleID <- str_match(data_log$Description, "(?i)\\bsection number '?\\s*(\\d+)")[,2]

# unique(ModuleID) # the actions applied on Modules that are hidden from students are from stuffs like Shimizu san, Eunkoo, and me. We are not removed before. 

#Extract activity ID
ActID <- str_match(data_log$Description, "(?i)\\bcourse module id '?\\s*(\\d+)")[,2]
# unique(ActID)

# Extract activity type. 
Act_type <- str_match(data_log$Event.context,  "(?<=\\[).+?(?=\\])")[,1]
# unique(Act_type)# Many students also accessed old version such as "OLD-Video".


```


```{r CourseLogData}
#CourseID is not added since it means this datavis course
course_log <- data.frame(data_log, ModuleID, LearnerID, ActID, Act_type)

NbLearner <- count(unique((course_log %>%
              filter(!is.na(Event.name) & !is.na(ModuleID)) %>%
              select(LearnerID))))

```

> The course started on **`r CourseStartDate`**. So far (`r as.Date(as.character(FileDate),format = "%Y%m%d")`), **`r paste0(NbLearner)`** different learners visited the platform and the course. Many different events can be extracted  from the data as well as the precise *time* of each event. We can therefore gather information at the learner or activity level. 
 

```{r TimeID}
# Main course data frame 
course_log <- course_log  %>%
           mutate(Date = str_split(course_log$Time, ", " , simplify = TRUE)[,1],
                  HoursMin = str_split(course_log$Time, ", " , simplify = TRUE)[,2])

course_log <- course_log  %>%
          mutate(HoursMin = format(strptime(course_log$HoursMin, "%H:%M"), format = "%H:%M"),
          Date = as.Date(course_log$Date, "%d/%m/%y"))%>%
          filter(Date >= CourseStartDate) # rm before the the course started (13 Jan)


# Create day time range
# extract the hour and create time range. 
t <- course_log %>%
  select(HoursMin) %>%
  extract(HoursMin, 'Time_range', regex = "([\\d.]+)[^\\d.]", remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(Time_range = as.numeric(Time_range))

# a loop for time range
  for (i in list(t$Time_range)) {
  i = paste0(formatC(i, format="d",flag="0",width=2),":00", "-", formatC(i+1, format="d",flag="0",width=2), ":00")
  course_log$Time_range <- i
}

# unique(course_log$Time_range)

course_log <- course_log %>%
  mutate(DayID = group_indices(., Date))%>%
  mutate(TimeID = as.numeric(str_extract(course_log$Time_range, "([\\d.]+)")), 
         DayOfWeek = lubridate::wday(Date), 
         IsSunday  = as.factor(DayOfWeek ==7)) 



```

                                          between(ActOrder, 14, 22) ~ 2,
                                          between(ActOrder, 23, 33) ~ 3,

                                            )) %>%
   mutate(ActOrder = formatC(ActOrder, format="d",flag="0",width=2)) %>%
  filter(ActOrder <=74 & ActOrder>0)

```


## Events {-}

After cleaning and refining the data, we have identified the  **`r length(unique(course_log$Actname))`**  different *activities* (resources such as videos, forums, articles, tests, polls, ..) in the course and reported in this log. 

When on the platform, the learners can interact with the activities in different ways. These interactions with the various types of activities can be regrouped in a typology of **`r length(unique(course_log$Event.name))-1`**  different type of events (as defined by Moodle)

```{r TypeEvents}
course_log %>%
  filter(!is.na(Event.name)) %>%
  mutate(SpecificEvent = ifelse(str_detect(Event.name, "Quiz"), "Test",
                                ifelse(str_detect(Event.name, "Discussion")|
                                         str_detect(Event.name, "Post"), "Forum","Other"))) %>%
  group_by(Event.name, SpecificEvent) %>%
  summarize(Learners = n_distinct(LearnerID)) %>% 
  #mutate(rank = dense_rank(desc(Learners))) %>% 
  #filter(rank <= 25) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=reorder(Event.name, Learners), y=Learners, fill= SpecificEvent)+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  labs(x="Events", y="Number of Learners", 
       subtitle = paste("The course has", length(unique(course_log$Event.name))-1,"different events (Final date ",
                        as.Date(as.character(FileDate),format = "%Y%m%d"),")"))+
  ggtitle("Total number of learners per type of activity")+
  scale_fill_manual("Type of Event",values=c("orange", "grey", SIAP.color)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=12),
        panel.background = element_blank(), text = element_text(size=8), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=8),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8))+
  coord_flip()

## Stat 
foo <-course_log %>%
  filter(
    str_detect(Event.name, "Quiz"))%>%
  mutate(
    Q = n_distinct(LearnerID) )

goo <-course_log %>%
  filter(
    str_detect(Event.name, "created"))%>%
  mutate(
    Q = n_distinct(LearnerID) )

hoo <-course_log %>%
  filter(
    str_detect(Event.context, "Forum"))%>%
  mutate(
    Q = n_distinct(ActID) )

```
This graphic shows in particular that among the  **`r paste0(NbLearner)`** participants who visited the course, only  **`r max(foo$Q)`**  ( *`r round(100* max(foo$Q)/NbLearner, 1)`* %)   viewed or attempted a quiz at least once.  We can also note that **`r max(goo$Q)`**  ( *`r round(100* max(goo$Q)/NbLearner, 1)`* %)  participants posted at least one post in any of the **`r max(hoo$Q)`** forums proposed.   

###  Events conducted by date and time of the day{-} 

We observe events over the whole period of the course and represent the activities by day. Tuesdays and Wednesday seem to be the most active days. There is a clear decline of activity on Sundays, while the activity is very important on Tuesdays, with the live lectures and webinars. The Chinese New Year has had little direct effect but may had  an indirect effect since the activity somehow explodes right after.       

```{r}

course_log %>%
  mutate(ParticularDays = ifelse(DayOfWeek ==7, "Sunday", 
                                 ifelse(DayOfWeek ==2 & DayID <45, "Webinar", "Regular"))  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(LearnerID)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  #aes(x=fct_infreq(Date))+
  aes(x = as.factor(DayID),  fill = ParticularDays)+
  geom_bar(color = "white" )+
   annotate("rect", xmin = 25, xmax = 32,
                  ymin = 0, ymax = 4500,
                  fill = "orange" , alpha = .2)+
   annotate("text", x = 28, y = 4000,
          color= "orange",
          label = "Chinese \n New Year")+
  labs(x="Day since start", y="Number of events", 
       subtitle = paste("Nb of days", length(unique(course_log$Date)),"(Final date: ",
                        as.Date(as.character(FileDate),format = "%Y%m%d"),")"))+
  ggtitle("Number of events recorded on the platform by date")+
  hrbrthemes::scale_fill_ft() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=12),
        panel.background = element_blank(), text = element_text(size=8), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=8),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10))

```

Since there is an important time difference between the teacher and the learners, it was important to have an idea of the learner's presence on the platform by hour.  The graphic below shows the maximum number of learners for different time periods of the day. 

```{r HourlyActivity, fig.height=3}
#Active time by Learners

course_log %>%
  filter(!is.na(Time_range)) %>%
  group_by(Time_range) %>%
  summarize(Learners = n_distinct(LearnerID)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=reorder(Time_range, Time_range), y=Learners, 
      fill = ifelse(Learners> 100, "High", "Low"))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+ 
  ggtitle("Number of Unique Visitors on the Platform by Hour")+
  labs(x="Time (JST)", y="Maximum Number of Learners", 
       subtitle = paste("Japan Time (Final date ", as.Date(as.character(FileDate),format = "%Y%m%d"),")"))+
 
  scale_fill_manual("Activity",values=c("orange", SIAP.color)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=12),
        panel.background = element_blank(), text = element_text(size=8), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=8),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60))

#  coord_flip()
  
```



    
### Learners preferred activities {-}

With no surprises, the learners' activities rank according to the modules order, with activities in module 1 on top and activities of modules 6 at the bottom. Some noticeable exceptions are the 6 quizzes, the data-based project and a homework,  that were more popular than other activities of their respective modules.    



```{r BarActivities, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width = "80%"}

final_date = as.Date(paste(FileDate), format = "%Y%m%d")

p <- course_log %>%
  filter(!is.na(ActID),
         Date <= final_date, 
         ModuleID_2 !=0) %>%
  mutate( ActID.lab = paste(ActID,"-",Event.context)) %>%
  group_by(ActID.lab) %>%
  summarize(Learners = n_distinct(LearnerID),
            ModuleID = as.factor(max(ModuleID_2))) %>% 
  #mutate(rank = dense_rank(desc(Learners))) %>% 
  #filter(rank <= 30) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=reorder(ActID.lab, Learners), y=Learners)+
  geom_bar( aes(fill = ModuleID),stat='identity')+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(wes_palette("Royal1")[1],wes_palette("Zissou1")) )+
  labs(x="Activities", y="Number of Learners", 
       subtitle = paste(nrow(subset(unique(course_log[c("ActID", "Date")]),
                                    Date==final_date)),"activities (Date ", final_date,")"))+
  ggtitle("Activities accessed by number of Learners")+
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=12),
        panel.background = element_blank(), text = element_text(size=8), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=8),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8))+
  coord_flip()

p
#ggplotly(p)

```

 
### Heatmap of the activities over time: 

This *heatmap* is an attempt to visualize the activities on the platform over time.  The coding is the following:

-  Horizontally:  time since beginning of course
-  Vertically:  activities (Module 1 at the bottom, module 6 at the top)
-  Heat = color:  Nb of views (Nb of Learners) for each activity 

```{r heatMap, fig.width=12, out.width = "90%"}
# course_log %>%
#   filter(!is.na(ActOrder)) %>%
#   mutate(ActOrder = formatC(ActOrder, format="d",flag="0",width=2))


#Both Date and Date ID work. Date: the specific date since beginning; DayID: the first date = 1, and the second = 2, ...
library(colorspace)

course_log %>%
  filter(!is.na(ActOrder), 
         ModuleID_2 <= 6) %>%
  mutate(ActID.lab = paste(ActOrder,"-",Event.context, "-", ModuleID_2)) %>%
  group_by(ActID.lab, Date) %>%
  summarize(Learners = n_distinct(LearnerID)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=Date, y= ActID.lab, fill=Learners)+

        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=8),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10))+

# We now have the full name in the grade file
Grades <- Grades %>%
  left_join(StudentsNames, by = c("Email.address"))
  
```





```{r ActivityTime}
learners_Time <-  course_log %>%
  select(User.full.name, LearnerID, , Actname, ActID, Event.name,Date, Time) %>%
  mutate(RealTime = lubridate::dmy_hm(Time)) %>%

            NbAct = length(unique(ActID)), 
            NbDays = length(unique(Date))) %>%
  ungroup()
```


```{r LearnersFile}
learners <- learners_Time %>%
  left_join(Grades, by = "User.full.name") 

```

Over the `r nrow(learners)` unique learners[^MyNote] registered for the course, only **`r learners%>% filter(TotalTest >0) %>% nrow()`** attempted  to at least one test and only **`r learners%>% filter(NbDays > 6 ) %>% nrow()`** visited the LMS more than 6 times (the course is 6-weeks long).  

[^MyNote]: We removed SIAP's lecturers from the list  as well as some learners registered with different emails, we count here **unique** learners.  


We noticed that *some* learners (around `r round(learners%>% filter(TotalTest >50 & NbAct < 21) %>% nrow(), -1)` -  `r round(learners%>% filter(TotalTest >50 & NbAct < 25) %>% nrow(), -1)`) had very good grades in their tests ( >50) while showing a **very limited activity on the LMS** (less than a third of available).  

```{r}
learners %>%
  filter(Country != "") %>%
 ggplot() +
 aes(x = NbAct, y = TotalTest, color = Country) +
 geom_jitter( width = 0.5, height = 0.5, alpha = 0.6) +
 ggtitle("Test Scores vs Number of Activities Viewed") +
 labs(x="Nb of activities viewed", y=" Total Score (over 60)", 
      subtitle = paste(nrow(subset(unique(course_log[c("ActID", "Date")]),
                                   Date==final_date)),"activities (date ", final_date,
                       "). Each dot is a participant"))+
  annotate("rect", xmin= 6, xmax = 26, 
          ymin = 50, ymax = 62, 
          color= SIAP.color, alpha = 0.2) +
 # facet_wrap(vars(Country)) +
 scale_color_hue() +
 theme_minimal()
```


The time spent by learners on the platform is, of course, proportional to the number of activities viewed, with a greater heterogeneity for the most serious learners who viewed most of the activities.[^Time] 

[^Time]: We do not always observe when someone leaves the platform. The duration reported here may reflect *"shadow"* activities while the learner was doing something else.    


```{r}

p <- learners %>%

## Grades {-}

We note that **`r learners%>% filter(GradeFinal >=70) %>% nrow()`**, over the **`r learners%>% filter(Project>0) %>% nrow() +6`**   who submitted a project (mandatory condition), succeeded with a grade above 70 (over 100). This is a rate of success of **`r round(100* (learners%>% filter(GradeFinal >=70) %>% nrow()) / (learners%>% filter(Project>0) %>% nrow() +6),1)`** %.

The distribution of grades presented below excludes here the  *`r learners%>% filter(GradeFinal ==0) %>% nrow()`* participants that did not participate in any of the tests (Grade =0).  


```{r Grades , fig.height=3}

learners %>%
  filter(GradeFinal >0) %>%
 ggplot() +
 aes(x = GradeFinal) +
 geom_histogram(bins = 100L, fill = SIAP.color, color = "white") +

 ggtitle("Grades distribution") +
 labs(x="Grades", y=" Nb of learners", 
      subtitle = paste("(date ", final_date,")"))+

                  ymin = 0, ymax = 32,
                  fill = SIAP.color , alpha = .2)+
   annotate("text", x = 78, y = 25,

## Learners

Since we have the information at the participant's level, we can have some statistics on the origin of the learners as well as performances by country. 

```{r}

 summarize(Learners = n_distinct(User.full.name)) %>%
 ggplot() +
 aes( x=reorder(Country, Learners), y=  Learners) +
 geom_bar(aes(fill = Country),stat='identity', alpha = 0.3)+
geom_text(aes(label= Learners, color = Country), vjust= 0.3, size=3.5,)+
 scale_fill_hue() +
 ggtitle("Learners origin") +
 labs(y = "Nb of learners enrolled", 
      x = "Countries (Ordered by Nb of participants)",
      subtitle = paste("(date ", final_date,")"))+
